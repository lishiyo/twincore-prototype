Dana - Private Design Notes - F0 Inspiration & Thoughts (March/April 2025)

Core Interaction Principles:
- Fluidity: Moving between conversation (transcript), structure (diagrams), and retrieval (twin) should feel seamless.
- Clarity: User should always understand *why* something appeared on the canvas (user action vs. AI suggestion). Provenance is key.
- Control: AI augments, doesn't dominate. User can always edit, delete, or ignore AI outputs.
- Calm Technology: Avoid excessive notifications or visual noise. Surface information when needed, not constantly. Minimalist aesthetic.

Inspiration Sources:
- Figma / FigJam: Gold standard for collaborative canvas UI. Smooth, intuitive, powerful. Need that level of responsiveness.
- Miro / Mural: More structured diagramming, good examples of object libraries and templates (maybe V2?). Miro's AI diagramming is a competitor feature - need to differentiate (real-time, conversational source, twin integration).
- Notion / Obsidian: Linking ideas, back-references. The concept of connecting diagram nodes back to transcript snippets borrows from this. Canvas should feel like a spatial knowledge graph.
- Arc Browser: Interesting UI patterns for sidebars, context switching. Maybe relevant for integrating the Twin chat without it feeling tacked on.
- Kinopio: Playful, spatial thinking canvas. Less formal than Figma. Reminds me to keep it somewhat inviting.

UI Challenges & Ideas:
- **Canvas Clutter:** How to manage potentially many AI-generated diagrams?
    - Auto-layout options? (Simple grid, force-directed?)
    - Manual grouping / framing?
    - Layers? (e.g., Show/hide all AI diagrams, show only diagrams related to 'budget')
    - Zoom-based visibility? (Details appear as you zoom in)
    - **Decision (V0):** Keep it simple first. Manual placement. Clutter management is V.next problem. Rely on linking, not necessarily spatial proximity.
- **Linking Transcript to Diagram:**
    - Highlight source transcript on node hover/select.
    - Maybe show source snippet in a tooltip on the node?
    - Visual indicator on transcript lines that have been diagrammed?
- **Twin Chat Integration:**
    - Sidebar feels standard. How to make it feel integrated?
    - Can Twin responses include direct links to canvas objects or transcript snippets? (e.g., "Decision X was made here [link to transcript line]"). Ben says technically feasible if objects have stable IDs. YES - crucial feature.
    - Visual distinction between user query and twin response.
- **AI Suggestions (Post-MVP):**
    - My mockup used subtle highlights + click-to-confirm icon. Need user testing to see if this is discoverable / annoying.
    - Where do confirmed items go? Added to a list? A dedicated section on canvas? Needs flow design.
- **"Make Diagram" Parameters?:** Just generate default concept map? Or offer choices (mind map, flowchart?)?
    - **Decision (V0):** Keep it simple. Default concept map only. Options add complexity.

Accessibility:
- Need good color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support (especially for transcript and twin chat).
- Diagrams are inherently visual - need text alternatives or summaries. Linking back to transcript helps.
