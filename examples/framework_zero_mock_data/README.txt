# README

We are testing out sending whole documents to Gemini 2.5 Pro instead of using RAG to find chunks. This folder has realistic simulated data for a project called Framework Zero, an AI-and-human collaboration framework to drive autonomous companies, incorporating human preferences at scale".

The files consist of:
- 30-60min long transcripts of 3 previous sessions on this project, where the first session had all 5 users, the second had 4, the third had 6 (with 1 external client giving feedback on the project)
- 6 shared group docs related to this project, including customer feedback, PRDs, mermaid diagrams, cost-benefit analysis, two interviews with external startups and their feedback
- private chat logs between all the users and their twins
- each user has 2 personal docs, some related to this project and some not
- the current meeting transcript (assume it's 45 minutes long) - this is session 4
