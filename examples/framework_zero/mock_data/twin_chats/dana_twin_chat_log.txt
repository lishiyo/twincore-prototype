[2025-03-18 10:02:00] Dana: Remind me of my action item from the kickoff.
[2025-03-18 10:02:05] Twin: Your action item from Session 1 (Project Kickoff) on 2025-03-10 was: Create initial mockups/wireframes for the canvas UI, focusing on the 'Make Diagram' interaction flow. You also took on designing the confirmation/suggestion interaction flow for AI-detected items later in the meeting.

[2025-03-25 09:40:00] Dana: Did Fiona give any specific feedback on the UI mockups in Session 3?
[2025-03-25 09:40:06] Twin: In Session 3, Fiona reacted positively to the visual mapping aspect of the 'Make Diagram' feature shown in your mockups and liked that it linked back to the transcript. She understood the Twin chat concept from the sidebar mockup. Her main UI-related feedback points were indirect:
*   Concerns about privacy/security imply the UI needs to clearly communicate data boundaries and provide controls.
*   Concerns about AI reliability imply the UI needs to clearly show the source of AI suggestions and allow easy confirmation/rejection.
*   You also raised a point about potential UI clutter from AI-generated elements, leading to an action item for you to explore management mechanisms (layers, collapsing, etc.).

[2025-04-01 11:25:00] Dana: What was the final decision on including the AI suggestion/confirmation flow in the MVP?
[2025-04-01 11:25:06] Twin: In Session 4 (MVP Feature Finalization), you suggested deferring the proactive AI suggestion/confirmation UI (highlighting potential AIs/Decisions) to post-MVP to simplify the initial release and focus on core features like user-triggered 'Make Diagram' and Twin Q&A. Ben and Alex agreed with this. Therefore, the decision was made to exclude proactive AI suggestions from the MVP scope.

[2025-04-01 11:30:00] Dana: What are my main UI tasks for the MVP based on Session 4?
[2025-04-01 11:30:07] Twin: Based on the decisions in Session 4, your main UI tasks for the MVP sprint are:
1.  Implement the basic manual canvas interaction tools (notes, shapes).
2.  Ensure the transcript display with text selection works smoothly.
3.  Implement the 'Make Diagram' button and ensure it integrates with Ben's backend logic.
4.  Implement the Twin chat interface for user queries and displaying responses.
5.  Add a document upload UI element with a 'private' option, integrating with the ingestion endpoint.
6.  Prioritize UI polish for these core features, including handling loading states and errors gracefully.
7.  Implement the basic concept map visualization (nodes/edges), potentially using a library like React Flow, ensuring it works with Yjs.
*   You also have a longer-term action item from Session 3 to explore UI mechanisms for managing canvas clutter (deferred post-MVP implementation but good to keep in mind).
*   Accessibility considerations (from your private notes) should also be factored in.
