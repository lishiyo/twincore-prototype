## Framework Zero - Investor Update Draft (Internal) - Early April 2025

**To:** Potential Angel Investors / Advisors
**From:** Alex, CEO Framework Zero
**Subject:** Progress Update & Upcoming MVP

Hi [Name],

Quick update on Framework Zero. We're making solid progress towards our goal of building a next-generation collaboration platform blending human input with AI orchestration on a shared canvas.

**Key Developments:**

*   **Team & Roles:** Core team (Alex - PM/CEO, Ben - Tech Cofounder, Chloe - Engineer, Dana - Designer, Ethan - Sales/Marketing) is collaborating effectively.
*   **Problem Validation:** Completed initial customer discovery calls (5 startups) and survey (20 respondents). Strong validation of pain points around meeting inefficiency, knowledge silos, and action item tracking. Feedback confirms high interest in our core concepts (real-time diagramming, personalized digital twin) but also highlights key requirements: robust privacy/security, AI reliability, and eventual integration with existing tools. (See attached summary or Session 3 notes for details).
*   **Technical Architecture:** Defined core stack: React/Yjs frontend, Python/FastAPI backend, AssemblyAI (transcription), Anthropic Claude 3 (LLM), Qdrant (vector store), Neo4j (knowledge graph), Supabase/Postgres (auth/data). Initial integrations are underway.
*   **MVP Scope Defined:** We've narrowed the focus for our initial Minimum Viable Product (targeting internal completion end of April):
    *   Real-time transcription/diarization.
    *   Basic collaborative canvas (manual edits).
    *   User-triggered "Make Diagram" from transcript selection (AI-generated concept map).
    *   Basic Digital Twin Q&A (personalized context retrieval from meetings/docs, respecting permissions).
    *   Simple document upload (private/shared).
*   **Early Feedback:** Presented mockups to Fiona (CEO, FutureWorks Inc.) who provided positive validation on the core value prop (reducing follow-ups, building institutional memory) and useful feedback on security/privacy requirements.

**Next Steps:**

*   **MVP Build Sprint:** Focused heads-down development over the next ~4 weeks to deliver the code-complete MVP.
*   **Internal Testing:** Rigorous testing of the MVP features, especially AI reliability and permission handling.
*   **Early Adopter Demo:** Aiming to demo the working MVP to select "friendlies" (like FutureWorks) in early May.

We believe this focused MVP will effectively demonstrate the core innovation of Framework Zero and provide a strong foundation for gathering user feedback and iterating towards product-market fit. Will keep you posted on progress.

Best,

Alex
