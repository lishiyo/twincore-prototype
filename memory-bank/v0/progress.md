# TwinCore Backend Prototype - Progress Log

REMEMBER TO PUT YOUR LATEST UPDATE AT TOP!

## Fri May  2 23:14:46 PDT 2025 - Completed Task 3.4: Qdrant DAL Implementation

### Changes since last update
- Implemented Qdrant DAL in `twincore_backend/dal/qdrant_dal.py`:
  - Created `QdrantDAL` class implementing the `IQdrantDAL` interface
  - Implemented core vector database operations:
    - `upsert_vector`: Handles point creation and updates, includes metadata and timestamp handling.
    - `search_vectors`: Implements semantic search with multiple filtering options (user, project, session, source type, privacy, twin interactions, timestamps).
    - `delete_vectors`: Handles deletion by chunk IDs or by various metadata filters.
  - Added error handling for Qdrant-specific and general exceptions.
- Created integration tests in `twincore_backend/tests/dal/test_qdrant_dal.py`:
  - Set up test fixtures for Qdrant client and DAL instance.
  - Implemented test collection fixture (`clean_test_collection`) ensuring clean state.
  - Added tests for all methods:
    - Upsert (new and update scenarios, optional fields, auto-ID generation).
    - Search (no filters, various single/multiple filters, timestamp ranges).
    - Delete (by chunk ID, by user ID, multiple filters, safety check for no filters).
  - Used cosine similarity for vector comparisons in tests.

### Design decisions
- Used injected async Qdrant client for testability.
- Handled timestamp conversion to Unix floats for Qdrant range queries.
- Implemented detailed filtering logic in `search_vectors` using Qdrant's `models.Filter` and `models.FieldCondition`.
- Implemented deletion by ID using `delete` with `PointIdsList` and by filter using `delete` with `FilterSelector`.
- Added pre-counting logic to `delete_vectors` to return an approximate count, necessary due to API limitations.

### Errors & Learnings
- Encountered significant challenges with Qdrant client/server compatibility (initially client 1.14.2 vs server 1.7.4).
- The Qdrant `delete` API operation does not return a reliable count of deleted items in older versions, requiring workarounds in the DAL method and tests.
- Debugging involved adding detailed logging, verifying API reference docs, and confirming client method signatures (`delete` vs `delete_points`).
- Resolved issues by downgrading the Qdrant client to 1.7.0 to match the server and adjusting the `delete_vectors` implementation and tests accordingly.
- Learned the importance of checking client/server compatibility and relying on actual state verification (retrieving points) in tests rather than API return values when APIs lack certain features.

### Next steps
- Implement core Ingestion Service logic (Task 3.5)
- Write integration tests for Ingestion Service

## Fri May  2 20:27:07 PDT 2025 - Completed Task 3.3: Neo4j DAL Implementation

## Changes since last update
- Implemented Neo4j DAL in `twincore_backend/dal/neo4j_dal.py`:
  - Created `Neo4jDAL` class implementing the `INeo4jDAL` interface
  - Implemented core node and relationship creation methods:
    - `create_node_if_not_exists`: Using Cypher MERGE for upsert behavior
    - `create_relationship_if_not_exists`: Creating relationships between existing nodes
  - Implemented query methods for retrieving context data:
    - `get_session_participants`: Gets users who participated in a session 
    - `get_project_context`: Gets comprehensive project context (sessions, documents, users)
  - Added thorough error handling for all database operations
  - Designed for dependency injection (can provide custom driver for testing)
- Created integration tests in `twincore_backend/tests/dal/test_neo4j_dal.py`:
  - Set up test fixtures for Neo4j driver and DAL instance
  - Added clean database fixture for test isolation
  - Implemented tests for all methods:
    - Node creation (new and existing)
    - Relationship creation (with various scenarios)
    - Participant and context retrieval
  - Tests verify idempotency of operations
  - Tests properly handle test database cleanup

## Design decisions
- Using Neo4j's MERGE operation for idempotent node creation
- Separating constraint properties from additional properties in node creation
- Implementing proper parameter prefixing in relationship creation to avoid conflicts
- Using async/await pattern throughout for consistency with the interface
- Building Cypher queries programmatically for maximum flexibility

## Fri May  2 20:22:01 PDT 2025 - Completed Task 3.2: DAL Interfaces

## Changes since last update
- Defined abstract base classes for all three database types in `twincore_backend/dal/interfaces.py`:
  - `IQdrantDAL`: Interface for vector database operations, with methods for upserting, searching, and deleting vectors
  - `INeo4jDAL`: Interface for graph database operations, with methods for creating nodes, relationships, and retrieving context data
  - `IPostgresSharedDAL`: Read-only interface for interacting with the shared Postgres database

## Design decisions
- Using Python's ABC (Abstract Base Class) approach for defining interfaces
- All interface methods defined as asynchronous (async/await) for consistent async pattern throughout the application
- Comprehensive method signatures with detailed typing information using Python's typing module
- Clear documentation for all methods with Args and Returns sections

## Fri May  2 19:58:57 PDT 2025 - Completed Task 3.1: Embedding Service

## Changes since last update
- Implemented the `EmbeddingService` in `twincore_backend/services/embedding_service.py`:
  - Created an async interface for generating embeddings using OpenAI's API
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios
  - Added caching of model information to reduce API calls
  - Added an `EmbeddingError` class for custom error handling

- Updated requirements to include OpenAI client library

## Design decisions
- Using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 as the default embedding model
- Implementing asynchronous methods for better scalability
- Setting up proper error handling and custom exceptions
- Following the single responsibility principle - the service only handles embedding generation
- Using environment variables for API key and model configuration
- Setting proper dimensions and error handling

## Learnings
- OpenAI's embeddings API returns normalized vectors by default
- The embedding dimensions for "text-embedding-ada-002" model is 1536
- Added proper error handling for rate limits, invalid inputs, and other potential failures
- Performance considerations: batch embedding requests when possible in future enhancements

## Next steps
- Define DAL Interfaces (Task 3.2)
- Implement Neo4j DAL (Task 3.3)
