# TwinCore Backend Prototype - Progress Log

REMEMBER TO PUT YOUR LATEST UPDATE AT TOP!

## Fri May  2 19:58:57 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Completed Task 3.1: Embedding Service
  - Added OpenAI to requirements.txt
  - Created `services/embedding_service.py` with the `EmbeddingService` class
  - Implemented async `get_embedding` method with the following features:
    - Support for single text or lists of texts
    - Proper error handling for empty/invalid inputs
    - Uses OpenAI embeddings API with "text-embedding-ada-002" model
    - Returns embeddings in the format required for Qdrant
  - Added proper exception classes for embedding-related errors
    - `EmbeddingServiceError` as base class
    - `ModelConfigurationError` for API key and model issues
    - `EmbeddingProcessError` for embedding generation errors
  - Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/services/test_embedding_service.py`
    - Tests for initialization with default and custom parameters
    - Tests for successful embedding generation (single and multiple texts)
    - Tests for error handling (empty input, invalid input, API errors)
    - Used AsyncMock to properly test async methods

### Commands
- `cd twincore_backend && pip install openai` - Install OpenAI dependency
- `cd twincore_backend && python -m pytest tests/services/test_embedding_service.py -v` - Run embedding service tests

### Errors & Learnings
- Learned to properly mock async API calls using AsyncMock instead of regular MagicMock
- Ensured test isolation by using proper mocking for the OpenAI client
- Used robust error handling for all potential failure points in the embedding process

### Next Steps
- Continue with Task 3.2: DAL Interfaces
- Define interfaces/protocols for Qdrant and Neo4j DALs in `dal/interfaces.py`

## Fri May  2 19:49:59 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Refactored database setup code for better modularity:
  - Created a dedicated directory `core/db_setup/` for database setup functions
  - Split functionality into focused modules:
    - `__init__.py` with the main `initialize_databases` function
    - `qdrant_setup.py` for Qdrant collection configuration 
    - `neo4j_setup.py` for Neo4j constraints setup
  - Moved code from monolithic `db_setup.py` to these modular files
- Removed synchronous client code in favor of fully async implementations
- Aligned structure with project's architectural guidelines for small, encapsulated modules

### Commands
- Refactoring was done manually, no specific commands to report
- Tested refactored code with existing test suite

### Errors & Learnings
- Smaller, focused modules are easier to maintain and test
- Following the architecture guidelines from `systemPatterns.md` leads to more maintainable code
- Removing synchronous code simplifies the codebase and avoids duplication

### Next Steps
- Continue with Phase 3: Embedding & Core Ingestion Logic
- Implement Task 3.1: Embedding Service

## Fri May  2 19:39:49 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Completed Task 2.4: Neo4j Constraints Setup
  - Created Neo4j constraint setup in `core/db_setup.py` to ensure all entities have unique identifiers
  - Added constraints for all node types defined in the data schema: User, Session, Message, Document, Topic, Organization, Team, Project, Preference, Vote
  - Modified `setup_neo4j_constraints` to accept optional driver parameter for better testability
  - Added integration tests in `tests/core/test_db_setup.py` for Neo4j constraint setup
  - Fixed test container configuration issues:
    - Updated Neo4j memory settings in docker-compose.test.yml to use correct parameters for Neo4j 5.x
    - Fixed Qdrant test setup to properly use the test port (7333)
    - Ensured proper test database credentials are used

### Commands
- `docker-compose -f twincore_backend/docker-compose.test.yml up -d` - Start test database containers
- `pytest tests/core/test_db_setup.py` - Run the database setup integration tests

### Errors & Learnings
- Neo4j 5.x uses different configuration parameter names than earlier versions
  - Changed from `dbms.memory.*` to `server.memory.*`
- For proper test isolation, use dedicated test drivers and explicitly pass them to functions
- Enhanced README with specific instructions for running database setup tests

### Next Steps
- Move on to Phase 3: Embedding & Core Ingestion Logic
- Implement Task 3.1: Embedding Service

## Fri May  2 18:54:23 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Fixed Task 2.3: Qdrant Collection Setup test issue
  - Resolved `AttributeError: 'CollectionInfo' object has no attribute 'vectors_config'` in Qdrant collection tests
  - Updated test assertions to properly check the CollectionInfo structure from Qdrant's API
  - Added debug output to better handle future API changes
  - Made the test more robust to handle different Qdrant response structures

### Errors & Learnings
- Qdrant API structure might differ between versions - our updated test is now flexible to handle variations in the response format
- Using debug prints helped identify the actual structure of the CollectionInfo object

### Next Steps
- Move on to Task 2.4: Neo4j Constraints Setup as originally planned

## Fri May  2 18:49:44 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Completed Task 2.3: Qdrant Collection Setup
  - Created `core/db_setup.py` with `setup_qdrant_collection` function.
    - Sets up `twin_memory` collection with size 384 and Cosine distance.
    - Includes placeholder `setup_neo4j_constraints` and main `initialize_databases` function.
  - Created `tests/integration/test_db_setup.py`.
    - Added integration test `test_setup_qdrant_collection_creates_collection` using test Qdrant instance.
    - Added idempotency test `test_setup_qdrant_collection_is_idempotent`.
    - Implemented `test_qdrant_client` fixture with proper setup and cleanup (collection deletion).
    - Ensured test client uses test database configuration.
    - Added cache clearing calls to fixture and test setup to handle LRU cache interactions.

### Commands
- `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_db_setup.py -v -s` (or similar, to run integration tests)

### Errors & Learnings
- Ensured integration tests properly clean up created resources (Qdrant collection).
- Handled potential exceptions during collection checking/creation in `core/db_setup.py`.
- Used specific test database settings for the integration test client.

### Next Steps
- Move on to Task 2.4: Neo4j Constraints Setup.

## Fri May  2 18:41:51 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Completed Task 2.2: Database Client Initialization
  - Added qdrant-client and neo4j to requirements.txt
  - Implemented client initialization in core/db_clients.py:
    - Created get_qdrant_client() function to initialize Qdrant connection
    - Created get_neo4j_driver() function to initialize Neo4j connection
    - Added health checks for both clients
    - Used lru_cache decorator to prevent multiple client instances
  - Wrote unit tests to verify client initialization with mock configurations

### Commands
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install database client dependencies
- `python -m pytest tests/core/test_db_clients.py -v` - Run unit tests for database clients

### Errors & Learnings

    - Neo4j on ports 7474/7687
    - Persistent volumes for both databases
  - Created docker-compose.test.yml for testing:
    - Qdrant test instance on ports 7333/7334
    - Neo4j test instance on ports 8474/8687
    - In-memory storage for faster testing
  - Updated README with Docker Compose usage documentation

### Commands
- No commands executed, but prepared Docker Compose files for future database setup

### Errors & Learnings

  - Verified that existing tests continue to pass

### Commands
- `cd twincore_backend && python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install new testing dependencies
