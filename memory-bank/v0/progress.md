# TwinCore Backend Prototype - Progress Log

REMEMBER TO PUT YOUR LATEST UPDATE AT TOP!

## Fri May  2 18:31:02 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Completed Task 1.3: Docker Setup for Databases
  - Created docker-compose.yml for development:
    - Qdrant on ports 6333/6334
    - Neo4j on ports 7474/7687
    - Persistent volumes for both databases
  - Created docker-compose.test.yml for testing:
    - Qdrant test instance on ports 7333/7334
    - Neo4j test instance on ports 8474/8687
    - In-memory storage for faster testing
  - Updated README with Docker Compose usage documentation

### Commands
- No commands executed, but prepared Docker Compose files for future database setup

### Errors & Learnings
- Used tmpfs for Neo4j and Qdrant test instances to ensure clean test environments
- Used different port mappings for test instances to avoid conflicts with development

### Next Steps
- Move to Phase 2: Core Data Models & DB Setup 
- Implement Task 2.2: Database Client Initialization
- Set up Qdrant collection and Neo4j constraints (Tasks 2.3, 2.4)


## Fri May  2 18:28:34 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Completed Task 1.2: Testing Setup
  - Added all testing dependencies to requirements.txt:
    - pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock, pytest-cov, schemathesis
  - Installed dependencies
  - Verified that existing tests continue to pass

### Commands
- `cd twincore_backend && python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install new testing dependencies
- `cd twincore_backend && python -m pytest` - Run tests to verify setup

### Errors & Learnings
- Received a deprecation warning from pytest-asyncio about asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope not being set
- Received a deprecation warning from schemathesis about jsonschema.exceptions.RefResolutionError
- Both warnings are non-blocking and can be addressed in future iterations if needed

### Next Steps
- Move on to Task 1.3: Docker Setup for Databases
- Create docker-compose files for Qdrant and Neo4j

## Fri May  2 18:08:50 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Completed Task 1.1: Project Initialization
  - Created twincore_backend directory structure with proper modules
  - Set up virtual environment (.venv)
  - Created requirements.txt with initial dependencies
  - Implemented basic FastAPI app structure with root endpoint
  - Created configuration module using pydantic-settings
  - Defined initial Pydantic models for API requests/responses
  - Added basic documentation (README.md)
- Set up testing infrastructure
  - Created basic test fixtures and configuration (pytest.ini, conftest.py)
  - Implemented and successfully ran test for root endpoint

### Commands
- `mkdir -p twincore_backend/api/routers twincore_backend/services twincore_backend/dal twincore_backend/core twincore_backend/tests` - Create directory structure
- `cd twincore_backend && python -m venv .venv` - Create virtual environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install dependencies
- `python -m pytest twincore_backend/tests/ -v` - Run tests

### Errors & Learnings
- None significant

### Next Steps
- Continue with Task 1.2: Testing Setup (add more testing dependencies)
- Proceed to Task 1.3: Docker Setup for Databases

## Fri May 2 18:00:38 PDT 2025

### Changes
- Completed planning phase for TwinCore backend prototype
- Created initial documentation:
  - `techContext.md`: Technical stack details (FastAPI, Qdrant, Neo4j, etc.)
  - `productContext.md`: Product goals, scope, and simulated entities
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Architectural patterns and directory structure
  - `tasks.md`: Comprehensive TDD-focused task breakdown (9 phases)
- Enhanced project scope to include LLM-based knowledge extraction (Phase 9)
- Prepared for implementation start with Task 1.1 (Project Initialization)

### Commands
- None executed yet (implementation phase about to begin)

### Errors & Learnings
- None yet

### Next Steps
- Begin Task 1.1: Project Initialization
  - Create project structure
  - Set up Python environment
  - Initialize basic FastAPI application
  - Implement first endpoint and test
