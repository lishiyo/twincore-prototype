# TwinCore Active Context - Fri May 2 18:00:38 PDT 2025

## Current Work Focus
- Beginning implementation of TwinCore backend prototype
- Starting with Task 1.1: Project Initialization

## Project State
### What's Working
- Planning phase completed
- Project architecture and technical stack defined
- Comprehensive task breakdown with TDD approach
- Implementation plan ready

### What's Broken
- N/A (implementation not started)

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Using FastAPI as the backend framework
- Integrating Qdrant for vector search and Neo4j for knowledge graph
- Implementing LLM-based knowledge extraction (Gemini) in Phase 9
- Following Test-Driven Development approach

## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Vector DB: Qdrant
- Graph DB: Neo4j
- Embedding: Sentence Transformers
- Knowledge Extraction: Gemini (Phase 9)
- Testing: pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx, pytest-mock, Schemathesis
- Configuration: Environment variables / .env files

## Next Steps
- Create project directory structure
- Initialize Python environment with venv
- Set up dependencies in requirements.txt
- Create basic FastAPI application structure
- Implement and test root endpoint
