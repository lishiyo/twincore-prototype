# TwinCore Active Context - Fri May  2 18:08:50 PDT 2025

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing TwinCore backend prototype
- Completed Task 1.1: Project Initialization
- Moving to Task 1.2: Testing Setup and Task 1.3: Docker Setup

## Project State
### What's Working
- Basic FastAPI application structure
- Root endpoint with test
- Project directory structure
- Python virtual environment
- Configuration using pydantic-settings
- Initial Pydantic models for API contracts

### What's Broken
- Nothing currently broken
- Database connections not yet implemented (planned for next tasks)

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Following the layered architecture defined in systemPatterns.md
- Implementing strict typing with Pydantic models
- Using Test-Driven Development approach consistently
- Planning to containerize Qdrant and Neo4j databases with Docker

## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Vector DB: Qdrant (not yet implemented)
- Graph DB: Neo4j (not yet implemented)
- Embedding: Sentence Transformers (not yet implemented)
- Knowledge Extraction: Gemini (Phase 9)
- Testing: pytest, httpx (implemented), pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock, Schemathesis (to be added in Task 1.2)
- Configuration: pydantic-settings with environment variables

## Next Steps
- Add additional testing dependencies and setup (Task 1.2)
- Create Docker Compose files for Qdrant and Neo4j (Task 1.3)
- Implement database client initialization (Task 2.2)
- Set up Qdrant collection and Neo4j constraints (Tasks 2.3, 2.4)
