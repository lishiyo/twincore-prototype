## Project State
### What's Working
- Basic FastAPI application structure
- Root endpoint with test
- Project directory structure
- Python virtual environment
- Configuration using pydantic-settings
- Initial Pydantic models for API contracts
- Full testing setup including pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx, pytest-mock, pytest-cov, schemathesis
- Docker Compose files for both development and testing environments
- Database client initialization for Qdrant and Neo4j with proper error handling
- Modular database setup utilities in `core/db_setup/` directory:
  - Qdrant collection setup (`qdrant_setup.py`)
  - Neo4j constraint setup (`neo4j_setup.py`) for all entity types
- Testing environment with properly configured test databases
- OpenAI-based Embedding Service with proper error handling and tests (updated to latest API format)
- DAL interfaces defined with clear method signatures for all three database types:
  - IQdrantDAL: Vector database operations interface
  - INeo4jDAL: Graph database operations interface
  - IPostgresSharedDAL: Read-only interface for shared Postgres (currently mocked/placeholder)
- Neo4j DAL implementation with all core CRUD operations and tests
- Qdrant DAL implementation with core `upsert`, `search`, and `delete` operations and integration tests
- Core Ingestion Service implementation with:
  - Proper integration with EmbeddingService, QdrantDAL, and Neo4jDAL
  - Helper methods for preparing Qdrant points and updating Neo4j graph
  - Comprehensive tests with mocked dependencies
  - Fixed user name property handling in Neo4j node creation
- Mock data module with realistic test data:
  - User entities (Alice, Bob, Charlie)
  - Project and session entities
  - Sample content (documents, messages, transcripts)
  - Private user content and twin interactions
  - Proper metadata structure with privacy flags
- DataSeederService for handling initial data seeding:
  - Takes IngestionService as dependency
  - Methods for seeding initial mock data and custom data
  - Comprehensive tests with mocked dependencies
- Admin API Router with endpoints for system operations:
  - `POST /v1/admin/api/seed_data` for initializing the system with mock data
  - `POST /v1/admin/api/clear_data` for clearing all data from the system
  - Tests for both success and error cases
- DataManagementService for system-wide database operations:
  - Method for coordinating data clearing across all databases
  - Proper separation of concerns from seeding functionality
  - Tests with mocked dependencies
- End-to-end tests verifying the full data seeding pipeline

### What's Broken
- Nothing currently broken - fixed all identified issues

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Following the layered architecture defined in systemPatterns.md
- Implementing strict typing with Pydantic models
- Using Test-Driven Development approach consistently
- Using Docker Compose to containerize Qdrant and Neo4j databases
- Separate development and testing database instances to ensure test isolation
- Using LRU cache for database clients to implement singleton pattern
- Defined Qdrant collection `twin_memory` with vector size 384 and Cosine distance
- Added flexible CollectionInfo attribute checking to handle potential Qdrant API changes
- Implementing dependency injection pattern for better testability (e.g., optional driver parameter)
- Using latest Neo4j 5.15.0 with proper configuration parameters
- Refactored code to have smaller, more focused modules (< 500 lines)
- Removed synchronous client code in favor of fully async implementations
- Using OpenAI for embedding generation with default model "text-embedding-ada-002"
- Designed DAL interfaces as abstract base classes with clear method signatures for all database operations
- Using Cypher MERGE operations for idempotent node/relationship creation in Neo4j
- Implementing thorough error handling in all database operations
- Setting up test fixtures for clean database state between tests
- Verified Qdrant client 1.7.0 works with server 1.7.4; adjusted `delete_vectors` implementation for compatibility
- Created a coordinated ingestion pipeline through the IngestionService
- Created comprehensive mock data representing the prototype's requirements
- Created a dedicated `DataSeederService` to separate seeding concerns from the `IngestionService`, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle
- Created a dedicated `DataManagementService` for operations that affect system-wide data state
- Using application-level dependency overrides in FastAPI for cleaner dependency injection
- Standardized API path convention to use `/v1` prefix for all endpoints
- Standardized on snake_case for all database property names (e.g., `user_id` not `userId`)
- Enhanced Neo4j session handling to support both synchronous and asynchronous drivers
- Updated embedding service to use the latest OpenAI API format

## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Vector DB: Qdrant 1.7.4 (via Docker)
- Graph DB: Neo4j 5.15.0 (via Docker)
- Embedding: OpenAI (text-embedding-ada-002)
- Knowledge Extraction: Gemini (Phase 9)
- Testing: pytest, httpx, pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock, pytest-cov, Schemathesis
- Configuration: pydantic-settings with environment variables
- Qdrant Client: 1.7.0

## Next Steps
- Implement Task 5.1: Ingest Message Endpoint
- Implement Task 5.2: Ingest Document Endpoint
