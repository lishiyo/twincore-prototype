# Framework Zero - Canvas for Human-AI Cooperation

# Framework Zero – Longform Strategic Summary

*Last updated: **May 2 2025***

---

## 1 · Vision

**Enable post‑labor, autonomous organizations that blend human creativity with transparent AI orchestration.**  Framework Zero (F0) exists to prove that productive entities can run largely on agentic workflows while remaining trustworthy, participatory, and adaptive.

## 2 · Mission & Core Principles

1. **Autonomy by Design** – Minimize human busy‑work; maximize strategic leverage.
2. **Radical Transparency** – Every decision path is explorable and auditable.
3. **Preference Aggregation at Scale** – Digital twins continually surface stakeholder intent.
4. **Composable, Open Infrastructure** – Integrate with best‑in‑class OSS agents and SaaS APIs rather than rebuilding wheels.
5. **Community‑Led Evolution** – Product direction is co‑shaped by early design partners and open‑source contributors.

## 3 · Problem Landscape

Traditional orgs suffer from meeting thrash, opaque decision chains, and tool sprawl. Existing AI products mostly **summarize after the fact** (Otter, Fireflies) or **assist individuals** (Copilot, Notion AI). No one offers a *real‑time* multiplayer canvas where conversation, artifacts, and autonomous agents converge—leaving a gap for F0’s canvas‑first wedge.

## 4 · Solution Overview

1. **Multiplayer AI Canvas** – Figma‑style board where participants and LLM agents co‑create diagrams, lists, and plans in real time.
2. **Digital Twin Layer** – Personal agents that ingest a user’s context (docs, voice, calendar) and whisper relevant insights or act on their behalf.
3. **Transparent Governance Hub** – Every agent action is logged; preference votes and rationales are queryable.
4. **Extensible Action Cortex** – Plug‑ins to schedule meetings, trigger code deployments, or post updates to Slack/Discord.

## 5 · Unique Value Proposition & Unfair Advantages

| Lever | Why it’s hard to copy |
| --- | --- |
| **SF deep‑tech network** | Ready pipeline of design‑partner teams in AGI House & Frontier Tower. |
| **Community‑building muscle** | Proven ability to host events that attract builders, feeding bottom‑up adoption. |
| **Narrative of Post‑Labor Org Design** | Distinctive story that aligns with academic & investor curiosity. |

## 6 · Beachhead Market & User Personas

1. **AI‑native startups** running weekly stand‑ups and product design sprints.
2. **Coworking collectives / innovation hubs** that coordinate many transient contributors.
3. **Research orgs** studying collective decision‑making and digital democracy.
    
    Initial TAM is small but influential, providing high‑signal feedback and viral exposure.
    

## 7 · MVP Scope

### 7.1 Ranked Feature Set

1. **“Make Diagram” Button** – One‑click generation of an editable graph from live transcript.
2. **Context‑Aware AI Chat Panel** – Ask “Highlight blockers” or “Summarize risks,” get board‑linked answers.
3. **Private Twin Whisperer** – Personal side‑chat retrieving user‑specific memories.
4. **Auto Meeting Summary → Context Packet** – Markdown/JSON export for downstream agents.
5. **Calendar & Follow‑Up Helper** – Draft invite with attendees + agenda suggestions.

### 7.2 Technical Architecture Snapshot

- **Frontend**: React + Vite ‑‑> Yjs CRDT sync
- **Realtime back‑end**: Supabase (Postgres + Realtime)
- **LLM interface**: OpenAI / Anthropic via LangGraph orchestrator
- **Voice ingest**: AssemblyAI diarization stream
- **Vector store**: Qdrant for board + memory embeddings

## 8 · 90‑Day Execution Roadmap

| Phase | Weeks | Milestones |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Proof‑of‑Concept* | 0‑2 | Manual transcript ➜ diagram generation; share Loom demo. |
| *Live Alpha* | 3‑4 | Real‑time voice → diagram; ship AI chat v0; run 3 live sessions. |
| *Twin Pilot* | 5‑8 | Private memory store + twin Q&A; 5 pilot users; collect telemetry. |
| *Growth & Fundraise Prep* | 9‑12 | Pricing page, KPI dashboard, seed‑deck draft; begin angel convos. |

## 9 · Community & Narrative Strategy

- **Weekly “Board Jam” livestream** showcasing new features on real community problems.
- **Thought‑leadership post**: “Multiplayer AI canvases as the kernel of post‑labor firms.”
- **Open‑source modules** (e.g., twin memory RAG) to spur contributor inflow.
- **Event presence** at Frontier Tower, AGI House, and local meetups (AI, post‑labor econ).

## 10 · Funding Path & Metrics we’ll Track

| Metric | Target @ Day‑90 |
| --- | --- |
| Active canvases / week | 30 |
| “Diagram” button CTR | ≥ 3× per meeting |
| Avg. meeting duration delta | −15 % vs baseline |
| Twin Q&A retention | 50 % weekly │ |
| Seed ask: **$1.5 M** for 18‑month runway to scale to 500 paid seats. |  |

## 11 · Risks & Mitigations

1. **LLM latency during live editing** → Progressive enhancement: async diagram mode ≤5 s fallback.
2. **Data privacy concerns** → End‑to‑end encryption for voice & board; SOC 2 roadmap.
3. **Competitor fast‑follow** → Double‑down on transparent governance & twin layer (harder moat).
4. **Founder bandwidth** → Delegate Frontier Tower ops; protect 20 h/wk maker time.

## 12 · Next 7‑Day Action Items

- Storyboard 90‑sec demo (May 4).
- Schedule 5 discovery calls; run Mom‑Test script (May 5‑7).
- Stand up Yjs + Supabase canvas skeleton (May 6‑8).
- Publish “Why the Canvas Wedge” blog draft for peer review (May 9).

## Appendix · Competitor Snapshot (May 2025)

| Category | Players | Gap they leave |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI Note‑takers | Otter, Fireflies, tl;dv | Post‑meeting only, no board edits |
| Canvas AI | Miro Diagram AI, Mural AI Chat | Gen‑once, not continuous, no twins |
| Agent Orchestration | CrewAI, LangGraph, BeeAI | Infra only—lacks UX & governance |
| Enterprise Copilots | Microsoft Copilot Pages | Heavy stack, slow to adapt |

> Core thesis: Real‑time AI‑augmented canvases create a high‑resolution substrate for preference capture, agent execution, and transparent governance—laying the first building block of truly autonomous, human‑aligned companies.
