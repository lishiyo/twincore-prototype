When writing to [progress.md](mdc:memory-bank/v0/progress.md) (our changelog), always use `date` in terminal to verify the current datetime. Append to the top of the file so that the most recent update is at top.

When writing to [activeContext.md](mdc:memory-bank/v0/activeContext.md) (our current work focus), also include the `date` but replace the existing content with our updated active context.

What we expect in these files:
- [progress.md](mdc:memory-bank/v0/progress.md) - our changelog
   * Changes since the last updates
   * Any new commands or changes to commands
   * Errors encountered and learnings from those
   * Next steps planned 
- [activeContext.md](mdc:memory-bank/v0/activeContext.md)
   * Current work focus
   * What's working
   * What's broken
   * Active decisions and considerations, if any
   * Important patterns and preferences, if any
   * Learnings and project insights, if any
   * Current database/model state if relevant
