We want small, modular, encapsulated files, ALWAYS less than 500 lines. If you are creating a large file OR planning to edit a file to make it longer than 500 lines, STOP CODING and ask me first so we can figure out a better way to design this.

We want to stay strictly to our target architecture. Whenever you plan to add new files and components, verify it is in the correct place by comparing it to the target structure in [systemPatterns.md](mdc:memory-bank/v0/systemPatterns.md). If your plan deviates from this structure, DO NOT CODE and ask me first.
